Hello Spring Boot
=================

Experience the full round-trip development and deployment lifecycle without a CLI but with a fully self bootstrapping local development environment.  This app uses Java, Spring Boot, Gradle, and Atom making it super easy to get started building web apps and microservices on Heroku.

1. Deploy this app on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)
1. Download the source for this app: https://github.com/jamesward/hello-springboot/archive/master.zip
1. Unzip the source and run `gradlew` to launch the local server and Atom code editor
1. Check out your local app: http://localhost:8080/
1. Make a change to the `src/main/java/com/example/HelloSpringBootApplication.java` file
1. Watch as your server reloads the changes and then check them out in your browser: http://localhost:8080/
1. From Atom, deploy your changes to Heroku by selecting the *Heroku* menu, then *Login*.  Once logged in, select the *Heroku* menu, then *Deploy*, then the app you want to deploy to.
1. Once your app changes are deployed, check them out and you are done!
